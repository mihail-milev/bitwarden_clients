# Kitchen Sink

The purpose of this story is to compose together all of our components. When snapshot tests run,
we'll be able to spot-check visual changes in a more app-like environment than just the isolated
stories. The stories for the Kitchen Sink exist to be tested by the Chromatic UI tests.

NOTE: These stories will treat "Light & Dark" mode as "Light" mode. This is done to avoid a bug with
the way that we render the same component twice in the same iframe and how that interacts with the
`router-outlet`.
